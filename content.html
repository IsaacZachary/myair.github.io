<!-- DBMS -->
<p>
    <b style="color: lime;"> DBMS</b><br>
   
    A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically 
    stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a 
    database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the
     applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system,
      often shortened to just database.
    Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled 
    in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. 
    The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. 
    Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.

<!-- this is our summary -->
<p style="text-align: center;" ><b style="color: lime;">Our Approach</b><br>
A working application can only be built by highly skilled employees.
These are the very people we have working on our team. The work of one team on all stages of the project life cycle has many advantages
 for clients. This eliminates the need to discuss and detail the information that was agreed with a previous implementer, our team 
 coordinates all the details in order to maximize the efficiency of the workflow. The change of developers is fraught for customers with 
 the loss of the necessary information, a large amount of financial and time resources. Our company will save your project from having to 
 look for a new contractor at every stage of development.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b style="color: lime;">Our Technologies</b><br>
We blueprint, build, and maintain advanced game, web, and mobile
apps for companies of all sizes. With the passage of time and the development of new technologies, 
as well as a large demand for IT services, the Multi-Programming Solutions team has identified key areas in software development and 
technologies that are used to create it. The following technologies are the most modern, popular, functional and useful in creating those 
solutions which we offer to our customers. The technologies we use help get any web project up and running within the shortest timeline and 
in the most cost efficient way.
